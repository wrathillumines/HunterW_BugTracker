Write a program that accepts two numbers between 1 and 100 from the user. The program
then iterates through all numbers from 1 to 100, printing numbers in ascending order to the
screen. For each number that is a multiple of the first number input by the user, print "Fizz"
instead of the number. For each number that is a multiple of the second number input by
the user, print "Buzz" instead of the number. For numbers that are multiples of both
numbers, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
